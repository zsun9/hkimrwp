We study search-andbargaining models of such markets to ascertain under what conditions trade might temporarily halt - a freeze with particular interest in the connection between this phenomenon and liquidity, and in the possibility that it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

For robustness, the paper uses alternative measures of contagion, one based on Forecast Error Variance Decomposition (FEVD) of daily realized volatility, and the other based on Delta Conditional Variance at Risk, with weekly share-market returns. We make use of recent advances in the Machine Learning literature, based on Elastic Net, Cross-Validation and Neural Network dimensionalityreduction methods. The results show that the US and Hong Kong Swaptions market volatilities are significant sources of systemic risk for Hong Kong banks. The Hong Kong Swaptions implied volatility not only responds to movements in the implied volatility of United States Swaptions, but also contains added information important for understanding ex-post realized volatility in the share prices of Hong Kong banks.",

    "abstracts":"Despite the increasing efforts to better understand the financial consequences of climate change, how climaterelated financial risks could spill over across borders largely remain unexplored. This paper finds that climate transition risks could spill across borders by increasing the bilateral co-movement of stock market returns. The effect of climate transition risks increases with greater similarity of economic condition and larger dependence on import between two countries. On the other hand, good country performances in combating climate change can help to reduce the impact, but an effective mitigation likely requires good performances by both. Our results have three implications. First, evidence of stock market co-movement due to climate transition risks suggests international stock market investors may have to consider such spillover risks in their risk management practice. This necessitates continuous improvements in climate risk disclosures by corporates and financial institutions. Secondly, the cross-border spillover of climate transition risks is a global rather than a regional issue. A country with lower transition risks is not immune to the impact of climate change risks because of the potential for international spillover. Thirdly, our findings highlight a strong need for international efforts to deal with the risks of climate change to financial stability.",

The bases of emerging market economies are found to fluctuate a lot more and move in a more disorderly manner over time, as compared to those of advanced economies.

To model such asymmetric dynamics, this paper provides a rigorous derivation of the asymmetric mean-reverting fundamental dynamics governing the unemployment rate based on a model of a simple labour supply and demand (fundamental) relationship, and shows that the fundamental dynamics is a unique choice following the Rayleigh process. By analogy, such a fundamental can be considered as a one-dimensional overdamped Brownian particle moving in a logarithmic\u2013harmonic potential well, and a simple prototype of stochastic heat engines. The solution of the model equation illustrates that the unemployment rate rises faster with more flattened potential well of the fundamental, more ample labour supply, and less anchored expectation of the unemployment rate, suggesting asymmetric unemployment rate dynamics in recessions and expansions. We perform explicit calibration of both the unemployment rate and fundamental dynamics, confirming the validity of our model for the fundamental dynamics.",

    "abstracts":"The March-2020 episode has raised questions on whether the post-GFC reforms on the liquidity management of open-ended funds\u2019 (OEFs) adequately contain their liquidity risk in times of market stress. Using an extensive dataset that covers this episode, our study shows that swing pricing could help to mitigate OEFs\u2019 redemption pressures in times of market stress. However, the mitigating effect may be limited by several factors. First, the swing pricing-led volatility of OEF returns would lead to a larger volatility of OEFs\u2019 flows. Secondly, swing pricing would encourage OEFs to raise leverage during normal periods, which may lead to substantial losses and amplify the redemption pressures in a stressful episode. Thirdly, some OEFs may not disclose the usage of swing pricing, but such non-disclosure practice could weaken the effectiveness of swing pricing. Our findings have two policy implications. First, while the results suggest that swing pricing would be one effective tool for liquidity management of OEFs, it may come with \u201cside effects\u201d, including larger flow volatility and higher leverage. A proper design and combination with other risk management tools may be warranted for swing pricing to work in a more effective way. Second, policies to promote a higher level of relevant disclosures may also enhance the effectiveness of swing pricing.",

Lockdown shocks originating in the most important trading partners have a strong and significant adverse effect on economic activity in the home economy. For stock prices and exports, the spillovers can even be larger than the effect of domestic lockdown shocks. The results are robust with respect to alternative country weights used to construct foreign shocks, i.e. weights based on foreign direct investment or the connectedness through value chains. We find that lockdown spillovers have been particularly strong during the first wave of the pandemic. Countries with a higher export share are particularly exposed to lockdown spillovers.",

Our empirical analysis confirms that (1) sound ESG practices by corporates could have a long-term cost reduction effect on their debt funding; (2) the effect on cost reduction is more evident for firms in high greenhouse gas emission sectors and during market turbulence, and; (3) the country-level ESG performance plays a role only since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015. Our study has three implications for firms and governments in the region. First, ESG-related risks have recently emerged in investors\u2019 concerns and need to be closely monitored as firms with relatively weak ESG scores are facing higher cost in funding their debts. Second, governments may consider further promoting sound ESG practices as both country-level and firm-specific ESG performances play a role in reducing firms\u2019 debt-funding costs. Third, with market participants starting to price-in firms\u2019 ESG risks in their investment, the lack of consistent and comparable ESG data could be a source of vulnerability itself, as disorderly adjustments might occur when pricing in ESG-related vulnerabilities. Therefore, government efforts on global initiatives aimed at strengthening international ESG reporting standards and promoting consistent ESG score methodology are vitally important.",

    "abstracts":"We examine whether the renminbi (RMB) is a safe-haven currency in terms of its effectiveness in hedging financial stress for global equity investors. The coskewness of the RMB (the covariance between the RMB premium and equity volatility) is mostly negative, implying that the RMB is not a good hedge in times of market volatility. Moreover, the positive cokurtosis of the RMB (the covariance between the RMB premium and equity skewness) implies that the RMB is unable to hedge against stock market crashes. Neither the coskewness nor the cokurtosis of the RMB is priced, suggesting that equity investors with skewness and kurtosis preferences would not use the RMB to hedge against financial stress. Therefore, the RMB is not yet a safe-haven currency.",

Moreover, the weakened monetary policy transmission from indebtedness is stronger in urban households than in rural households. This can be explained by the investment good characteristic of houses in China.",

Investors sign contracts to hedge an underlying exposure. There is counterparty risk because investors can default on the contract due to idiosyncratic shocks and moral hazard. Mutualization of losses can thus hedge against counterparty risk but demands collateral for preventing moral hazard. The optimal contract involves loss mutualization, which requires central clearing, only when the cost of collateral is intermediate. Furthermore, as loss mutualization dilutes investors\u2019 incentives to monitor their counterparties, a third-party CCP can emerge as a centralized monitor and is given a \ufb01rst-loss, equity tranche as incentive compensation. Our results endogenize key features of the default resolution process, known as \u201cdefault waterfall\u201d, in a CCP. Finally, we show that larger user base of a contract favors central clearing (over bilateral trading) and clearing with third-party CCP (over member owned CCP).",

    "abstracts":"Since China joined the World Trade Organisation in 2001, the Chinese economy has grown rapidly, especially the tradable goods sector. However, the Chinese real exchange rate did not exhibit a persistent and stable appreciation until 2005. This is a puzzling fact that is inconsistent with theories. This paper documents several stylized facts during the economic transition and argues that two features of the Chinese economy may help explain the puzzling real exchange rate pattern for the Chinese economy: i) the faster total factor productivity (TFP) growth in the export sector compared with the import sector; and ii) excess supply of unskilled labor. We construct a small open economy model with an H-O trade structure. We show that, due to heterogeneous skilled labor intensity in export and import sectors, faster TFP growth in the export sector over that in the import sector will lead to the decline of return to capital and a rise of the skilled wage. Therefore, the decrease of return to capital and the persistent low unskilled wage, which is caused by the excess supply of unskilled labor, inhibit the rise in the relative price of non-tradable goods to tradable goods and the appreciation of the real exchange rate. Furthermore, we develop a dynamic small open economy model with multiple tradable goods sectors. We show that the model does fairly well in explaining the Chinese real exchange rate and other stylized facts in the economic transition. Finally, we demonstrate that our hypotheses are supported by cross-country evidence.",

This paper examines the behaviours, sources, and drivers of the spread between China\u2019s exchange and interbank repo rates from December 2006 to June 2018. After adjusting for different day-count quoting methods, I dissect the exchange to interbank repo spread into two components: cross-market segmentation between exchange and interbank markets for non-depository institutions (NDIs), and within-market counterparty segmentation between NDIs and depository institutions (DIs) in the interbank market. The 1-day repo markets are found to be more segmented, with the spread mainly driven by the cross-market segmentation for NDIs, reflecting the two different market mechanisms and trading frictions that prevent NDIs from effectively arbitraging across the two markets in the shorter tenor. On the other hand, the 7-day repo markets are found to be less segmented, with the spread mainly driven by the counterparty segmentation between NDIs and DIs within the interbank market, reflecting greater counterparty credit and liquidity risks for NDIs relative to DIs. Further analysis uncovers the impacts of quarter-end effect, monetary policies, and shadow banking activities on the cross-market and within-market segmentations in China\u2019s repo markets.",

This study aims at identifying the reasons behind the persistent trade slowdown by using a panel regression model with data of 22 Advanced Economies (AEs) and 17 Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). Our study suggests that the slowdown in global exports is mainly driven by: (i) the loosening in domestic income elasticity to exports among EMEs; (ii) the decline in foreign demand elasticity to goods exports amid the deceleration of global investment; (iii) the deglobalisation momentum amid the declining global value chain (GVC) activities and the uncertainty in trade policies since the China-US trade war; and (iv) the supply side factors including the narrowing AEs-EMEs wage gap and the diminishing US dollar trade finance condition. Moreover, these negative factors have affected mainly goods exports rather than services exports, which by comparison remained resilient until the Covid-19 pandemic. The results imply that the trend of global trade, especially goods trade, is unlikely to rebound to the pre-GFC level, as the above negative factors are likely to prolong in the post-pandemic era.",

Allowing the expected return and variance of the market\u2019s return proportional to the square of the state variable governing changes in production and investment opportunities over time suggests the state variable following an asymmetric mean-reverting process with strong counteracting force at the ZLB representing the credibility of the bound committed by a central bank. Empirical calibrations of the proposed process for the US and French government bond yields show that the process can adequately describe their dynamics. While the yields were bounded above the ZLB during most of the time, as indicated by their dynamics, the conditions for breaching the bound were met in January 2013 for the French government bond and March 2020 for the US Treasury using only information until those points. The economic and financial condition uncertainties are negatively co-integrated with the mean reversion in the dynamics, suggesting increased likelihood of the yield breaching the ZLB and erosion of the credibility of the bound amid higher uncertainties.",

Our proposed model predicts that the transition from a manufacturing-oriented economy to a service-oriented economy affects the world interest rates through the balance of payment channel by changing the relative price of the non-tradables in the foreign country. Specifically, labour transfer without efficiency improvements in the tradable sector tends to lower the world interest rate, while economic transition triggered by initial productivity gains in the tradable sector tends to push up the interest rate. Our model also predicts that aging causes the real interest rate to fall, though by a small amount. Since interest rate movement during economic transition is small, its feedback effect on output and the real exchange rate is not large. Contrarily, labour transfer and aging have significant impacts on domestic output, besides the initial productivity gains (if any) in the tradable sector. Exchange rates and foreign output are also affected by domestic transition, especially when transition is triggered by efficiency improvement in domestic tradable sector.",

In particular, an initial redemption shock to ETFs with a low cash buffer level could lead to a downward spiral in fund performance and outflow, which could expand a downturn to the broader financial market. Given the widespread existence of cash-redeemable ETFs in Europe and emerging market economies, our results point to the potential financial vulnerability of these regions, if these ETFs are redeemed in a large scale.

    "abstracts":"A sign of emerging downward trends in the carbon intensity of energy (CO2 intensity) is an early indicator of progress in transitioning to low-emission energy. To trade off the obligation of reducing carbon emissions against the cost saving benefits of using fossil fuels, a country may choose an optimal share of use of lowemission energy. We use the partial adjustment model based on the trade-off theory of firms\u2019 capital structure to investigate whether countries adjust their CO2 intensities towards specific targets. Using the sample covering 62 economies from 1992 to 2013, we find that the gaps between their actual and target CO2 intensities narrow over time, suggesting adjustment towards their optimal levels of the use of low-emission energy. Countries with a higher degree of financial development display faster downward than upward speeds of adjustment towards targets. However, the opposite applies to countries with a lower degree of financial development. Consistently, countries with a higher (lower) degree of financial development adjusted their CO2 intensities faster (slower) downward and slower (faster) upward towards their targets. Such findings are not related to the state of economic development of the countries. This demonstrates that financial development plays an important role in mitigating CO2 emissions.",

    "abstracts":"Market sentiments influence the dynamics of Hong Kong\u2019s macro-critical property market, but the unobservable nature of market sentiments makes it difficult to assess systemically this sentiment channel. Using text-mining techniques, this paper sets up a news-based property market sentiment index and a Google Trends-based buyer incentive index for Hong Kong, and studies the sentiment channel of transmission in the Hong Kong property market. The news-based property market sentiment index can reflect the change in sentiments in past key events, with the sentiments in the primary market tending to lead that of the secondary market during the low housing supply period. For the Google Buyer Incentive Index, we find that it has value-added in forecasting (or nowcasting) the official property price index. In mapping out the sentiment channel using a structural vectorautoregressive (SVAR) model, we find that an improvement in market sentiments could stimulate buyers\u2019 incentives, which then together would affect property prices and transaction volumes.",

    "abstracts":"The USD non-financial corporate debt in the EMEAP economies has been growing rapidly since the outbreak of Global Financial Crisis (GFC). However, bonds in the region have shown deterioration in overall quality and increasing issuance of short-term bonds. These may expose firms to higher rollover risks, especially during stress periods. Our empirical analysis confirms the importance of rollover risk in driving up the default risk of non-financial corporates after controlling financial characteristics of individual firms and country risk factor. The results also show that the risks during periods of financial distress are mainly found in emerging market economies (EMs) of the region. We also find that within the investment grade (IG) universe, BBB rated bonds, which are subject to greater fallen angel risks and account for a higher share of IG bonds after the GFC, would be exposed to higher default risk due to the elevated rollover risks. Our findings have three financial stability implications. First, while the low interest rate environment may provide breathing space for corporates, the accumulation of debts may raise concerns about the debt sustainability problem of corporates in the region. Second, the increasing reliance on shorter maturity bonds may expose firms systemically to a sharp rise in funding cost and rollover risks should US monetary policy tighten. Third, EMs, particularly those with weaker economic fundamentals should stay vigilant to the increasing exposures of their corporate sector to USD bonds and the potential currency mismatch problem, as these vulnerabilities could rise sharply if their economies are under stress.",

China is likely to be no exception. However, specific characteristics in China\u2019s bond markets raise two major questions. First do China\u2019s Treasury bonds offer the benchmark term structure of yields, or is this role fulfilled by the young but fast expanding corporate bond market? In other words, where does price discovery take place in the Chinese bond market in terms of the different components of the yield curve? We identify both dynamic and long-run relationships between each of the level, slope and curvature factors of the Treasury and corporate bond markets yield curve in China. We aim at determining which market plays a leading role in the discovery of each factor of the yield curve. We obtain three main results. First, we document for the first time the presence of a long-run relationship between the corporate and Treasury bond markets in China both for the level and the slope of their yield curve. Second, such a long-run relationship appears to be stable between the slopes over the full sample 2006-2017, but shows a break for the level factor in 2012. Third, the source market for price discovery varies with the parameters of the yield curve. While the corporate bond market is the source of price discovery for the level factor, this function is fulfilled by the government bond market for the slope parameter.",

This paper empirically investigates the effects of bank complexity of the global banks (in terms of their business activities and geographical locations) on the riskiness of their affiliates, using a confidential data set of foreign bank affiliates based in Hong Kong (FBHKs). Our empirical findings based on a panel regression model suggest that the complexity of global banks has significant effects on the riskiness of their foreign bank affiliates, but the effects differ between the two complexity dimensions. Specifically, a FBHK from a more business complex banking group tend to have higher risks, and the effect is likely to be attributable to an intensified agency problem. For the geographical complexity, there is tentative evidence to support the presence of both diversification and agency problems. However, the average effect on the riskiness of FBHKs is found to be less clear-cut. To strengthen the identification, we further employ an alternative difference-in-difference (DID) estimation approach. This approach exploits the exogenous decline in bank complexity of the parent group arising from the introduction of GSIB regulatory framework. The DID results are consistent with the findings identified from the panel regression model.",

In orderly markets, idiosyncratic dollar strength, and its volatility and market expectations, are key factors affecting the stress for the economy. Monetary policy divergence, which to a large extent reflects the position of the economy relative to the US in the economic cycle, also plays an important role in the short-term funding market. In turbulent markets, the effect of these variables except the volatility of dollar strength against individual currencies, which retains a strong influence, diminishes or even vanishes. Instead, the credit worthiness of the government and corporate sectors, which is found to have little impact under normal market conditions, emerges as a major stress determinant, and becomes increasingly influential as adversity intensifies.",

Based on a standard flexible-price monetary framework, this paper extends a target-zone model in which the intervention policy is incorporated by specifying the asymmetric mean-reverting fundamental dynamics with the smooth-pasting condition at a moving boundary. The solution of the model shows that the exchange rate dynamics is more sensitive to the change in the fundamental when the domestic interest rate is constrained at zero, suggesting more intensive interventions are required to counteract currency appreciation pressure. The empirical results using market data during January 2015 \u2013 February 2020 demonstrate that the model can describe the dynamics of the Swiss franc exchange rate following the mean-reverting square-root process. The accumulation of foreign reserves through interventions is negatively co-integrated with the exchange rate volatility and the value of the mean level of the Swiss franc exchange rate in the dynamics, to some extent indicating a reasonably high degree of effectiveness of the Swiss National Bank\u2019s interventions.",

Moreover, this shock has spillover effects on other Asian economies, leading to a fall in asset prices and GDP. Particularly, an increase in uncertainty leads to a drop in stock prices throughout the region. Hence, uncertainty about the PBOC\u2019s monetary policy is an additional channel of transmission that coexists with the transmission of the PBOC monetary policy itself.

Moreover, we find that education and underlying health conditions affect these portfolio outcomes largely through proxies of time household heads devote to asset management. Our key findings hold up against a battery of robustness and internal validation tests based on reduced-form and structural IV regressions, alternative regression specifications, and alternative groups of investors.

    "abstracts":"This paper investigates the effects of monetary and foreign exchange policies on the exchange rate in China. In the empirical model, a multiple number of monetary and foreign exchange policy instruments, such as the shortterm interest rate, reserve requirement ratio, lending and borrowing rates, and foreign exchange intervention, are considered to describe Chinese monetary and foreign exchange policy properly. In addition, the interactions among these instruments and their interactions with the exchange rate are modelled carefully to analyze the effects of monetary and foreign exchange policies on the exchange rate properly. The main findings are as follows. First, (contractionary) monetary policy shocks lead to the exchange rate appreciation, which is statistically significant. It is particularly interesting that shocks to all popular monetary policy instruments, such as the short-term interest rate, reserve requirement ratio, lending and borrowing rates, have significant effects on exchange rate. Second, shocks to foreign exchange interventions have limited effects on the exchange rate. Shocks to foreign exchange interventions have significant effect on the exchange rate in the short-run at best, but not in the long run. Even a persistent (or permanent) foreign exchange intervention has a temporary effect on exchange rate. In addition, a temporary foreign exchange intervention does not have any significant effect on exchange rate. Sterilisation is likely to explain the limited effect of foreign exchange intervention on the exchange rate. The trend of exchange rate movements may mostly be determined by economic fundamentals, not by foreign exchange intervention, especially sterilised one. The presence of capital controls might be related to the weak effect.",

    "abstracts":"This paper examines the impact of business diversification of banks on their risk, with efficiency taken into consideration as a conduit. Using bank-level data from more than 1400 commercial banks in 39 emerging economies during 2000-2016, we find that increased business diversification exerts two competing effects on bank risk, and overall reduces bank risk. The direct effect of increased diversification bolsters the stability of banks, but this is offset partially by the indirect effect of lowered efficiency, which increases the riskiness of banks. This provides a consolidating evidence on the competing arguments on the diversification-efficiency nexus in banking--the \u201cdiversification-premium\u201d argument vs. the \u201cdiversification-discount\u201d argument--with its extended implications on bank risk. In addition, we also present evidence that the diversification-bank risk nexus is heterogeneous on the bank size, market power and the ownership of banks, which provides useful policy implications for diversification strategies by bank managers as well as for the effective surveillance by bank regulators.

    "abstracts":"I study optimal credit, monetary, and \ufb01scal policy under commitment in a model where \ufb01nancial intermediaries face an occasionally binding \ufb01nancial constraint; the monetary authority faces a zero lower bound (ZLB); and the \ufb01scal authority faces a budget constraint. Despite being inactive in the deterministic steady state, the credit policy is permanent in the risky steady state. Financial and productivity shocks can generate a tradeo\ufb00 between in\ufb02ation stability and \ufb01nancial stability, which is resolved in favour of the latter with the credit spread being virtually equal to zero under a reasonable calibration. As the ZLB prevents full-scale monetary easing when \ufb01nancial distress weighs on aggregate demand, monetary policy should be relatively tighter in normal times for a precautionary reason. Moreover, the optimal nominal interest rate is a bell-shaped function of productivity around the stochastic steady state, although it is sensitive to how much the central bank is constrained by its past commitments. Notwithstanding the mentioned policy tradeo\ufb00, the optimal Taylor type rule is strictly in\ufb02ation targeting. However, the rule-based policy features too aggressive a credit intervention but insu\ufb03cient monetary easing. JEL classification: E44, E52, E6, C61",

    "abstracts":"Our paper presents a crude oil price model in which the price is confined in a wide moving band. A price crash occurs when the price breaches the lower boundary where a smooth-pasting condition is imposed. Using an asymmetric mean-reverting fundamental (supply\/demand) shock, the solution derived from the oil price equation for the model shows the oil price follows a mean-reverting square-root process, which is quasibounded at the boundary. The oil price dynamics generates left-skewed price distributions consistent with empirical observations. A weakened mean-reverting force for the price increases the probability leakage for the price across the boundary and the risk of a price crash. The empirical results show the oil price dynamics can be calibrated according to the model, where the mean reversion of the price dynamics is positively co-integrated with the oil production reaction to negative demand shocks, and with the risk reversals of the commodity currencies, the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar in currency option markets. The results are consistent with an increased price crash risk with negative demand shocks and negative risk reversals. The forecasting performance of the oil price model is better than the futures-spread models and random walk models during the crash periods. While the price of oil was above the lower boundary for most of the time, the conditions for breaching the boundary were met in 2008 and 2014 when the price fell sharply.

Investors appear to underprice unproductive firms and overprice productive firms. We find evidence consistent with the speculative overpricing of productive firms driven by investor sentiment and short sale constraints. Investors erroneously extrapolate past productivity growth and its associated operating performance and stock returns, despite their subsequent reversals. Such mispricing is perpetuated because of limits to arbitrage and is partially corrected around earnings announcements when investors are surprised by unexpected earnings news. Decomposition analysis indicates that extrapolative mispricing and limits to arbitrage explain most of the return predictability of firm-level productivity. JEL classification: D23; D24; G12; G14",

We explain in simple economic terms why the price premium of a green bond essentially represents a combination of the non-pecuniary environmental benefit of the bond, as perceived by the investor, and the effective cost of issuing it, as measured by the additional issuing costs of the bond netted off a range of monetary and non-monetary benefits associated with the issuance. Our empirical model decomposes the greenium into a time-varying market component which is common to all green bonds and an idiosyncratic component which is specific to a certain green bond itself. Using a global green bond dataset larger than any previous studies, we find that the greenium on average amounts to, sadly, just over one basis point. However, it can vary quite significantly among individual green bonds and our result suggests that a key factor underlying the variation is that they are subject to the risk of greenwashing to different extents.",

    "abstracts":"The Hong Kong banking sector is embracing Fintech vigorously. The survey results indicate that on the whole incumbent banks considering Fintech as a complement and enabling technology, which facilitates them to improve efficiency and to meet the demand for under-served customers, out-number significantly those seeing it as a threat and a replacement for their existing businesses. Given vast interests and growing adoption of Fintech by banks, the impact of Fintech is being increasingly felt, with most banks surveyed previously considering themselves unaffected now realise that they could not be immune. Either proactively or passively, most incumbent banks have taken a pragmatic approach and have made tangible efforts to adopt Fintech in their business operations. As of today, a wide range of Fintech innovations have been adopted generally in banks\u2019 operations, albeit by various degrees. In particular, innovations relating to \u201cmobile banking\u201d, \u201copen banking (APIs)\u201d, \u201ccustomer identification and authentication\u201d, \u201cmachine learning and predictive analytics\u201d and \u201ccloud computing\u201d have been rather commonly applied, with over 40% to up to two thirds of the incumbent banks revealing that these have been partially adopted in their institutions; and most respondents intend to apply more of them to either a limited or full extent. For \u201croboadvisory\u201d, \u201cregtech solution\u201d, \u201cdistributed ledger (e.g. blockchain)\u201d and \u201csmart contracts\u201d, while related applications have been less widely used, most respondents either are using or plan to apply them in the future. In general, the applications of Fintech amongst foreign banks have been less widespread than retail banks, with the exception of the use of \u201cmachine learning and predictive analytics\u201d and \u201crobo-advisory\u201d. As for virtual banks, they have shown keen interest in almost all identified solutions.",

Our results show that following Basel I, short-term commitments increased as undrawn fees declined (relative to those of long-term commitments). These results are robust and appear to be driven by the Basel I Accord: they are more prevalent among low-capital banks and do not hold in several placebo tests. We estimate that banks are willing to pay at least $0.05 to reduce regulatory capital by one dollar. While this in-ferred cost might appear to be low, our results show that the relative decline in short-term commitment prices induced by Basel I triggered a large shift in quantities, underscoring the sensitivity of credit to regulatory capital regimes.",

As policy makers worldwide grapple with sluggish growth there are few studies about the extent to which the G4, which consists of the US, the Eurozone, Japan, and includes China, as a block contributes to global economic performance in a fashion that is not observed when China is omitted or treated as exogenous perhaps because of its status as an emerging-market economy. We estimate a series of panel factor vector autoregressions (VARs) because these seem best suited to exploit cross-border links and determine the relative impact of domestic and global factors. We conclude that domestic and global shocks can reinforce each other. Next, we conclude it is essential to view China on a level playing field with the US, the Eurozone and Japan if we are to better understand how shocks among these economies can interact with each other. In addition, a tightening of domestic monetary conditions results in a global deterioration in real economic conditions. This same shock also leads to global tightening of monetary policy and financial conditions. Almost 60% of the variability of the global monetary shock can be explained by shocks in global commodity factor and global real factor. We conclude that there are net benefits from greater policy coordination.",

We investigate how far this is true by examining the contribution of benchmark-driven investment to the volatility of foreign portfolio flows of emerging markets, focusing on equity flows, and the sensitivity of benchmarkdriven investment to factors that tend to have an influence on the global economy or emerging markets. Interestingly, we find that benchmark-driven-investment-related flows are generally less volatile, thus having an effect of reducing, rather than increasing, the overall volatility of foreign portfolio flows. However, our results also show that they are more interconnected with each other due possibly to their higher sensitivity to global and emerging-market-related factors, supporting the notion that their rapid growth could make emerging markets more vulnerable in times of extreme market adversity, as sudden and simultaneous withdrawal of portfolio flows would potentially expose them to greater risks of external financing or balance of payment difficulties.",

Our empirical results find that online channel adoption improves the profit efficiency (i.e., positive return) of the adopting banks. Even though cost efficiency deteriorates, such improvement can be attributed to the rise in non-interest income efficiency. In reference to risk management, online channel adoption weakens the loan quality of the adopting banks, which also raises their solvency risk accordingly. Overall, our results suggest that online channel adoption alters the risk-return trade-off of adopting banks. Such risk-return effects are heterogeneous depending on the size, management skill and labour intensity of adopting banks. However, there is no significant return related to the costly content enrichment of online channels. Finally, our results are robust to alternative specifications, alternative sample selection, alternative measures of bank efficiency and risk, alternative estimation methods, and omitted variable biases.",

    "abstracts":"It is well documented in literature that funding condition has been subject to the undue influence of distorted incentives of banks to lend and borrow at quarter ends under Basel III. We investigate whether or not funding risk possibly also suffers the same. Using a state space model, we find quarter-end spikes in the Japanese yen Libor-OIS spread, which arguably reflect a higher funding risk premium at quarter ends, during the global financial crisis and in recent years. The phenomenon in the former episode suggests that quarter-end reporting under Basel II might already have an effect on the functioning of funding markets, as banks found the capital ratio requirement sharply more binding or constraining. The spikes in the latter episode, which are attributable to the effect of the leverage ratio requirement under Basel III, are found to be negative, reflecting partly the scarcity of high-quality collaterals against the backdrop of a large-scale asset-purchase programme introduced by the Bank of Japan and partly a negative interest rate environment. The evidence adds to the argument in favour of supervisory practices that require banks to report\/disclose their average leverage ratio for the quarter instead of their ratio for the last day of the quarter. However, despite the currently proposed reform, given that the capital ratio remains quarter-end-based, there could still be quarter-end spikes in funding risk premium in times of financial adversity.",

Our empirical evidence indicates that the complexity of the parent company has significant effects on their Hong Kong branch\u2019s business model, liquidity management, risk-taking, and profitability. The more complex the global banking organizations, the more likely their Hong Kong FBOs are to derive a larger share of revenues from fee-based activities, and incur a higher cost of production despite enjoying a funding cost advantage. Notwithstanding the FBOs in Hong Kong may serve as a funding hub for its parent company, FBOs of more complex global banks tend to hold more liquid assets. While our empirical evidence suggests that the complexity of global banks has significant effects on FBOs\u2019 risk-taking and profitability, the relation depends on how complexity is measured. For example, both the BCBS complexity score and the measure of geographic complexity are significant in explaining FBO profitability, but they have different signs. Likewise, geographic complexity and scope complexity are often found to have significantly different effects on FBOs\u2019 performance. Taken together, the concept of global bank complexity has multiple dimensions, where different facets could have qualitatively different effects on FBOs in Hong Kong.",

We construct KF* for 184 countries and, for the subset of countries that have quarterly time series data of capital flows, we show that KF* is a level to which flows converge in the medium term. That is, KF* appears to help identify the underlying persistent component in gross portfolio inflows by differentiating between longer-term structural flows and short-term cyclical noise.

A crash occurs when the exchange rate breaches a lower boundary where a smooth-pasting condition is imposed. The Bitcoin exchange rate is quasi-bounded at the boundary, and generates skewed distributions consistent with empirical observations. The crash risk increases with a weakened mean-reverting force for the exchange rate. The empirical results show the exchange rate dynamics can be calibrated according to the model, in which the mean reversion of the dynamics is positively co-integrated with the Bitcoin transaction volume indicating demand for Bitcoin; and with the risk reversals of the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar in currency option markets. The analysis based on the monetary model shows that the Bitcoin exchange rate shares some characteristics of a currency with crash risk.",

This note discusses the implications of the framework proposed by So et al. (2019) which incorporates the risk that arises from the portfolio performance and flows of actively managed bond funds. When the framework is applied to the data, using local currency sovereign bonds of 16 EMEs, preliminary calculations show that local currency sovereign bonds that positively covary with the returns of active funds receive risk premia as compensations for active fund risk. Furthermore, and in line with theory, the price of this risk increases when bond funds experience outflows and the exposure to active funds risk increases with the heightened price of risk. This double effect helps explain why spikes in returns of some EME local currency bonds can be especially large. These results demonstrate how the portfolio performance and flows of actively managed funds help transmit shocks across EMEs.",

In this paper we jointly analyze global drivers of gross flows (outflows plus inflows) and net flows (outflows minus inflows) by estimating a latent factor model. We find evidence of two global factors, which we call the GFC (global financial cycle) factor and a commodity price factor as they closely track respectively the Miranda-Agrippino and Rey asset price factor and an average of oil and gas prices. These factors together account for half the variance of gross flows in advanced countries and forty percent of the variance of gross flows in emerging markets. But remarkably, they also account for forty percent of the variance of net capital flows in both groups of countries. We also analyze the heterogeneity across countries in the impact of the two factors. One of the key findings is that the impact of the GFC factor on both gross and net capital flows is stronger in countries that have larger net debt liabilities. Other asset classes (FDI and portfolio equity) do not significantly impact the exposure to the GFC factor.",

We test simple composite indices of limits-to-arbitrage or investment frictions. The competing explanations are compared by controlling the frictions indices against each other in regressions and by analyzing the effect of orthogonalized frictions indices. Both classical and Bayesian inferences show that limits-to-arbitrage tend to be supported by more evidence than investment frictions for all investment measures. Investment frictions are clearly important for investment-to-assets. Various robustness checks regarding model specifications and index definitions are performed. The relative importance of the two hypotheses depends on the variables used in constructing the indices. When idiosyncratic volatility and cash flow volatility are used in measuring investment frictions, the inference is more favorable for the rational explanation.",

However, the magnitude of the impact of demographic changes is small; with the variance decomposition revealing demographic shocks contribute to no more than 1% of annual inflation fluctuations over a 10-year horizon. Among the three economies, Hong Kong and Mainland China are more sensitive to demographic changes than Singapore. Although disinflation, as a consequence of an aging population, may not be the primary concern in the short term, the cumulative effect of aging on disinflation should not be ignored when the aging process persists or accelerates.

    "abstracts":"In moving from a quantity to an interest rate-based policy framework, the PBoC uses a variety of monetary policy instruments and intermediate targets, which is different from central banks of main industrial countries. Contrary to most studies on overall effects of monetary policy, this research empirically investigates the effects of various types of monetary policy instruments separately by modeling the interactions and relationship among monetary policy instruments and other monetary variables such as monetary policy targets, to draw implications forhighlight the PBoC\u2019s attempt to change the monetary policy framework to an interest rate based framework. Empirical results suggest the effects of the changes in benchmark lending rates and short-term interest rates on loan, M2 and output are larger than those of the changes in reserve requirement ratio, especially in recent years. Non-policy shocks exert substantial effects on intermediate targets, such as loans and M2, under a quantity-based policy framework. These results may imply that monetary policy is more effective under a new interest rate-based policy framework than the old quantity-based policy framework. Empirical results also suggest that the size and effects of short-term interest rate shocks are larger in recent years, which shows the push by the PBoC to move from a quantity-based policy framework to an interest rate-based policy framework has progressed significantly. In addition, short-term interest rates have the strongest effect on property price, among various policy instruments. This could suggest that the PBoC\u2019s interest rate based framework is likely more effective in achieving its financial stability objective. Overall, the empirical results support the idea that the new interest rate-based policy framework is more effective in achieving not only traditional macroeconomic objectives, but also new financial stability objectives.",

    "abstracts":"We present an exchange rate model in which a currency\u2019s exchange rate is confined in a wide moving band and a currency crash occurs when the rate breaches the lower boundary. A solution is derived from the standard log exchange rate equation for the model with a smooth-pasting condition at the lower boundary. Using an asymmetric mean-reverting fundamental shock, the solution shows the exchange rate follows a mean-reverting square-root process, which is quasibounded at the boundary, and generates left-skewed exchange rate distributions consistent with empirical observations. The probability leakage for the exchange rate across the boundary increases with a weakened mean-reverting force for the exchange rate, suggesting an increase in currency crash risk. The empirical results show the exchange rates of nine major currencies against the US dollar can be calibrated according to the model, where the mean reversion is negatively cointegrated with the risk reversals in currency option markets, as expected by the model, and are consistent with the positive relationship between currency crash risk and risk reversals. The leakage condition for breaching the lower boundaries was met during the 2008 global financial crisis when most of the currencies were under the disaster shock.",

    "abstracts":"This study investigates the net effects of sectoral loan concentration on banks in Hong Kong. Research in this area remains inconclusive, due to the potential trade-off between concentration risks and specialisation gains. Our empirical results, based on a regulatory panel dataset of licensed banks in Hong Kong, find support for the specialisation gain from higher loan concentration, which would more than offset the concentration risk after controlling for the differences in loan composition and common risk factors. While this finding may, to some extent, alleviate concerns about the rising sectoral concentration in banks\u2019 loan portfolios observed after the global financial crisis, it is important to note that the net impact on an individual bank\u2019s loan loss provision ratio also depends on how far the bank allocates its loan portfolio towards riskier sectors. A key implication is that changes in the sectoral concentration and composition in banks\u2019 loan portfolios should be monitored jointly to have a more balanced assessment of the risk and return of banks\u2019 loan portfolios.",

We use a novel dataset based on individual funds issued by insurance companies and pension funds worldwide. This allows us to examine each economic region in conjunction with the remaining regions, not in isolation as in bilateral flow-based analysis. Overall, our results indicate that these institutional investors would be counter-cyclical (i.e., they buy past losers and sell past winners) for most stock markets (including Hong Kong) during normal market conditions, which could temper upward and downward movements in asset prices. During adverse market conditions, these investors would become procyclical for some stock markets in advanced economies, which could exacerbate price volatility. This implies that these long-term institutions would have a destabilising impact on these markets during the market downturns. The pro-cyclicality may reflect that some AEs were the epicentre of several major stock market crashes during the sample period. Moreover, the influence of pro-cyclicality would be reinforced by the LTIIs\u2019 herding behaviour.",

However, the effects of such policies on the core objectives of monetary policy to stabilise output and inflation are largely unknown. In this paper we quantify the effects of changes in maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios on output and inflation. We rely on a narrative identification approach based on detailed reading of policy-makers\u2019 objectives when implementing the measures. We find that over a four year horizon, a 10 percentage point decrease in the maximum LTV ratio leads to a 1.1% reduction in output. As a rule of thumb, the impact of a 10 percentage point LTV tightening can be viewed as roughly comparable to that of a 25 basis point increase in the policy rate. However, the effects are imprecisely estimated and the effect is only present in emerging market economies. We also find that tightening LTV limits has larger economic effects than loosening them. At the same time, we show that changes in maximum LTV ratios have substantial effects on credit and house price growth. Using inverse propensity weights to rerandomise LTV actions, we show that these effects are likely causal.",

To study the consequences of SOEs for monetary policy transmission, we differentiate between expansionary and restrictive policy shocks and argue that SOEs generally suffer less from a policy tightening and benefit more from a policy easing. Based on sector-specific macroeconomic time series and a large firm-level da-ta set, we provide evidence of a systematic and sizeable asymmetry in the transmission of monetary policy shocks in China. The nature of the asymmetry is consistent with the notion of explicit or implicit govern-ment guarantees of SOEs and has consequences for the adjustment of aggregate variables.

We suggest that these models do not account for emerging market vulnerabilities to global shocks such as advanced economy monetary policy changes, US dollar movements, or shifts in global liquidity and risk-aversion. A novel multi-country dataset of corporate defaults allows us to quantify the importance of global shocks on emerging market corporate distress. Using a set of accounting, market, and macroeconomic variables, we develop a model of distress risk specific to emerging markets with comparable forecasting power to that of existing models based on US data. We also explore the asset pricing implications of our model by testing whether equity returns accurately reflect default risk. We find that global factors like US interest rates and credit risk contribute more predictive power for corporate default risk than domestic macroeconomic variables, especially for those firms whose stock returns are most sensitive to global financial conditions.",

In contrast, the excess returns of gross assets over gross liabilities, which mostly correspond to the sizable capital gains from the latter, are negative. These results occur mainly because of the composition e\ufb00ect between risky liabilities and safe assets, where China takes a short position in equity and a long position in debt.

    "abstracts":"We examine the impact of Chinese monetary policies on excess local bond yields (the spreads over Chinese government bonds), on local bonds issued by Chinese local government entities. We find that an expansion in M2 generally raises the excess yields on bonds issued by local government entities, and the impact is amplified for bonds issued by the local governments. This last category is considered as as having a high degree of existing resource misallocation. Our estimation results confirm that excess yield on local bonds can be an indicator of market risk of local government debts and the financial efficiency of local governments.",

    "abstracts":"This paper investigates the degree of risk sharing across households in China with heterogeneous risk and time preferences from the late 1990s to early 2010s. Standard tests assume homogeneous preferences across households, which may bias the true risk sharing degree if, in reality, preferences correlate with variations of household income. We use household data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) and China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) to show that, in China, the incomes of less risk-averse and less patient households correlate more positively with the aggregate risk. The standard test, which ignores this correlation, shows about 30% of household income shocks pass through to household consumption. However, this number reduces to 3% and becomes insigni\ufb01cant when preferences heterogeneity is accounted for. By comparing this result with that of the US, we \ufb01nd the degree of risk sharing across households in China is similar to that in the US. We argue that this improvement of risk sharing from the standard test to tests with preferences heterogeneity is due to the institutional changes and labour market reforms that took place during the mid-1990s and early 2000s. This gave individuals more freedom in their labour market choices, which makes preferences heterogeneity more relevant, as people can choose occupations more aligned with their preferences. We then use the Research Center on the Rural Economy (RCRE) Fixed Point Rural Household Survey data to provide empirical evidence of the e\ufb00ect of reforms on household risk sharing.",

    "abstracts":"This paper investigates the interconnectedness among cross-border shadow banking systems using a broad measure of shadow banking defined by the Financial Stability Board. We find these interconnections are tenuous during tranquil periods, but the systems are significantly linked in times of tightening global liquidity conditions. The interconnectedness can be mostly explained by investors\u2019 search-for-yield behaviour, financial linkages between banks, capital stringency and demand from institutional investors. After controlling for effects of these driving factors, the interconnections are generally insignificant, except the shadow banking system in North America remains influential worldwide. The results reflect that the shadow banking system in North America cannot be fully explained by conventional risk factors as it is far more complicated than those in other economies. Our finding highlights that the spillover risk of shadow banking is not limited by national boundaries, which requires policymakers and regulators to co-ordinate closely with their foreign counterparts. It also draws a possible policy implication for introducing necessary macro-prudential policies, such as monitoring banks\u2019 exposures to shadow banking risk and ensuring adequate supply of alternative safe assets, to mitigate the risk of shadow banking being materialised.",

    "abstracts":"We investigate the relationship between net inflow to mutual bond funds that invest in emerging market economies (EMEs) and the past performance of these funds. Our main finding is that EME bond funds display a convex flow-performance relationship. In other words, past performance is a significant factor driving fund inflow when the fund return is positive but its influence vanishes when the return is negative. This convex flow-performance relationship is arguably attributable to practices taken by fund management companies to dampen fund investors\u2019 incentives to redeem in reaction to poor performance, bias of media coverage towards outperforming funds, and the relatively high participation costs of EME bond funds. Furthermore, we found that fund performance directly and indirectly affects fund flow. In particular, the performance of a volatile fund is typically less influential on its future fund flow. This can potentially be explained by investors\u2019 perception of the volatile return being less informative. We also found that a larger fund would generally record a higher sensitivity in its fund flow in response to a given change of past performance.",

This paper considers the evolving heterogeneity in China\u2019s house price dynamics across 70 cities and assess the main determinants. We gauge the heterogeneity of house price dynamics using a novel regime-switching modelling approach to estimate the time-varying patterns of China\u2019s city-level housing price synchronization. After sorting city-level housing prices into four clusters sharing similar cyclical features, we see that each group shows increasing synchronization in the years leading up to 2015, and a decoupling pattern thereafter. We document high synchronization within each of the clusters of cities, but low synchronization among them. The empirical evidence suggests that differentials in the growth of households, income, investment and even differences in air quality explain housing price synchronization among cities.",

In the past decade, the governments of most developed economies have paid very low interest rates, and there are many other periods in the past in which this has been the case. In this paper, we revisit the implications of the FTPL in a world where the rate of return on government debt may be below the growth rate of the economy, considering different sources for the low returns: dynamic inefficiency, the liquidity premium of government debt, or its favorable risk profile.",

    "abstracts":"Many studies have provided evidence that the correlation between firm-level productivity and export status is driven by more productive firms self-selecting into exporting. Nevertheless, a few studies have also found evidence for a reverse channel of causation. Especially in developing or transition economies, exporters have been found to improve their productivity performance after they enter the export market and start selling abroad. In this study, we provide evidence for one particular channel to explain this finding of learning-by-exporting in a sample of Chinese manufacturing firms. Our evidence suggests that small domestic firms often fail to fully realize all scale economies that the technology in their industry allows. Estimating flexible translog production functions, we find that in most industries marginal costs have the familiar U-shaped pattern. At low levels of output, scale economies are increasing. It implies that a non-negligible share of firms in our sample would be able to raise productivity if they operated at a larger scale. Entering the export market enables these small firms to expand output and generate productivity gains by exploiting scale economies. It is indeed the case that more non-exporters than exporters operate below minimum efficient scale. The question then begs why some domestic firms remain sub-optimally small. We conjecture and provide some evidence that this is due to limited access to finance and weak contract enforcement at home. Once domestic firms accumulate a high outstanding balance of trade credit (accounts receivables), they become reluctant to expand their sales further as awarding additional credit to new clients becomes too risky. We find that the firms with the most outstanding trade credit expand sales the most following export market entry. This is especially true if they operate in industries with higher scale economies or if they are located in provinces with weaker institutions. We further show that the same type of firms also enjoy the largest productivity gains immediately following export market entry.",
