      <p class="row">For at least a decade, in policy circles, China has been considered a systematically important economy. As policy makers worldwide grapple with sluggish growth there are few studies about the extent to which the G4, which consists of the US, the Eurozone, Japan, and includes China, as a block contributes to global economic performance in a fashion that is not observed when China is omitted or treated as exogenous perhaps because of its status as an emerging-market economy. We estimate a series of panel factor vector autoregressions (VARs) because these seem best suited to exploit cross-border links and determine the relative impact of domestic and global factors. We conclude that domestic and global shocks can reinforce each other. Next, we conclude it is essential to view China on a level playing field with the US, the Eurozone and Japan if we are to better understand how shocks among these economies can interact with each other. In addition, a tightening of domestic monetary conditions results in a global deterioration in real economic conditions. This same shock also leads to global tightening of monetary policy and financial conditions. Almost 60% of the variability of the global monetary shock can be explained by shocks in global commodity factor and global real factor. We conclude that there are net benefits from greater policy coordination.</p>
