      <p class="row">The gravity model can explain the bilateral inter-country payment ﬂowsbycurrencyvery well. The economic sizes of the origin and destination countries signiﬁcantly and positively aﬀect bilateral payment ﬂow denominated in any given currency, while distance and other factors that increase trade costs or information friction signiﬁcantly and negatively aﬀect the bilateral pay-ment ﬂow denominated in any given currency. In addition, the GDP of the issuing country, the strength of trade relationship between each country and the issuing country, the co-movement between the exchange rates of each country and the currency in question, signiﬁcantly and positively aﬀect the bilateral payment ﬂow denominated in the currency. Most importantly, ﬁ-nancial development and openness of the issuing country positively aﬀect the bilateral payment ﬂow denominated in the currency between two countries. We carry out two sets of counter-factuals, both of which demonstrate that the increase in China’s level of ﬁnancial development & openness would be much more important than the increase in the economic size of China for the RMB to become a signiﬁcant global payment currency.</p>
